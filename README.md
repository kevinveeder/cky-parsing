# cky-parsing
This project implements a syntactic parser using the CKY (Cocke–Kasami–Younger) algorithm trained on the ATIS (Air Travel Information System) dataset from the Penn Treebank. It applies key concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as grammar induction, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) conversion, and probabilistic parsing using NLTK.
